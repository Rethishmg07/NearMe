        <p> Skandashram is a sacred cave on Arunachala Hill in Tiruvannamalai where Sri Ramana Maharshi lived from 1916 to 1922. It's a popular spot for meditation and offers a bird's-eye view of the Arunachaleshwarar Temple. The ashram can be reached by a scenic uphill path that starts from the back of Ramanashram and is a popular pilgrimage site for spiritual seekers. 
Historical Significance: It was Ramana Maharshi's residence before he moved to the current Ramanashram after his mother's passing. The ashram retains the cave where he meditated, which is now preserved as a meditation hall for visitors. There is also a small room where his mother, Alagammal, lived.
Accessibility: The ashram is located about 1.4 kilometers uphill from Ramanashram. The path is rocky and can be challenging, so it's recommended to wear appropriate footwear or walk barefoot when the stones are hot. The path to Skandashram is also part of the way to Virupaksha Cave.
Meditation and Views: The ashram is a place renowned for its peaceful and meditative atmosphere. From its location on the hillside, it provides a panoramic view of the Arunachaleshwarar Temple. </p>
