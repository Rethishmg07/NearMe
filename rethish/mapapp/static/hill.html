        <p style="font-size: 25;">Arunachala Hill is a sacred mountain in Tiruvannamalai, South India, revered by Hindus as a physical manifestation of Lord Shiva. It is considered one of the five main Shaivite holy places and is associated with the fire element (Tejo Linga). The mountain is famous for its spiritual significance, the practice of circumambulating it (Giri Pradakshina), and the history of saints and sages, like Ramana Maharshi, who have meditated there. 
Spiritual significance
Manifestation of Shiva: According to mythology, Shiva appeared as a column of fire between Brahma and Vishnu, and this light took the form of Arunachala Hill.
Symbol of Shiva: The hill is regarded as the "first lingam" (Adi-Lingam), symbolizing the supreme being in the form of a fire mountain.
Spiritual benefits: It is believed that simply seeing or thinking of the hill can neutralize karma, and a circumambulation around its base is considered a spiritually beneficial act. </p>
